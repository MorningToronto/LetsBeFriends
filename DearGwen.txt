Hello there G.,

Your first task would be to fork this repo. Write reply and send pull request to me.

After that, after I'll reply in my repo, you will need to update your fork, 
instruction how to do it you could find in StackOverflow link I have sent you, and 
you could find PNG screenshot I also left here.

But before that we would need to fix your GitHub connectivity problem I'm afraid. Well,
you could fork LetsBeFriends using GitHub website at least.

On Friday SpaceX launched CRS-8 Dragon spacecraft. Was such a fun watchig it live! Should 
have dialed your number at that moment - I think you would have enjoed watchig it...

Dragon is about to dock with ISS now, and there was a fun part - for the first time ever
first stage landed on a barge in the ocean...

Ohh, well... But how about I call you today anyway? Like around 5pm-6pm? May be.

S. texted me about Monday. Drink would be nice, but how about picking some kind-hearted
movie for that evening?

Vitaly
